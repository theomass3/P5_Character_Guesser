Dear Austin, we took a slightly different route for deserialize.
Instead of taking in a parameter (String s), deserialize has no parameters,
 yet it reads the tree in the form of a String from the first line of the file
 "tree.txt" This can be changed if needed, but we figured it would be more convenient
  to source the tree from the same file that we serialize it to. That way if we made a change to the tree
  during runtime, that change would be persistent throughout different compilations of the code.

  Best,
  Theo and Luke

  This project was the work and ideas of Luke and Theo, yet we sought
  some help from you (Austin) as well as we researched file
  writing and manipulation from W3Schools and GeekForGeeks.
